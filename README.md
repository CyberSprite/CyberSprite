# 👋 Hello, World! I'm CyberSprite

## 🎓 Computer Science Student | 🤖 AI/ML Enthusiast | ♟️ Chess Player | 🎮 Gamer

### About Me

I'm a passionate Computer Science student with a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. When I'm not coding, you can find me strategizing over a chess board or exploring virtual worlds in computer games.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on:
  - Developing a chess AI using deep learning techniques
  - Contributing to open-source ML projects
  - Building a personal portfolio website

- 🌱 I'm currently learning:
  - Advanced algorithms and data structures
  - TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning
  - Cloud computing platforms (AWS, Google Cloud)

- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on:
  - AI/ML projects, especially in game development or strategy games
  - Open-source initiatives that make AI more accessible
  - Hackathons and coding competitions

- 🤔 I'm looking for help with:
  - Optimizing neural network architectures
  - Implementing efficient game search algorithms
  - Best practices in software engineering for AI projects

- 💬 Ask me about:
  - Machine learning algorithms and their applications
  - Chess strategies and opening theories
  - My favorite computer games and their underlying technologies

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- ⚡ Fun facts:
  - I've played chess against a Grandmaster (and lost gracefully!)
  - I can solve a Rubik's cube in under 2 minutes
  - I once stayed up for 48 hours straight coding my first game
